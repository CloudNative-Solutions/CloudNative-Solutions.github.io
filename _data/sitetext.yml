      - title: "Infrastructure & Process Audit"
        desc: "Our infrastructure and process audit service can help you assess the efficiency of your computing infrastructure. Within a few weeks, our team will run your infrastructure through our comprehensive checklists and identify areas that are working well and areas that need improvement. This audit is a valuable tool for executives to plan and budget, for engineering teams to identify overlooked areas, for investors to perform due diligence, and for customers to assess vendor risk. We often find issues such as unmitigated risks, missing processes or checks, unnecessary spending, and inefficiencies that can lead to serious problems such as downtime, data loss, security breaches, or financial loss. We provide prioritized recommendations for improvement based on our findings."
